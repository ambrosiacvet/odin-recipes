    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large deep pan or dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
            Add 2 Tbsp oil and once oil is very hot, add thinly sliced beef strips in a single layer, 
            cooking 1 minute per side without stirring. Cook until just browned and no longer red. 
            Sear beef in 2 batches so you don't overcrowd the pan. 
            Remove beef to a plate and cover to keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>Add 2 Tbsp butter, chopped onion and sliced mushrooms. 
            Sautee 6-8 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and onions 
            and mushrooms are soft and lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>Add 1 minced garlic clove and sautee 1 minute until fragrant. 
            Add 1 Tbsp flour and sautee another minute stirring constantly.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in 1 cups beef broth, scraping any bits from the bottom of the pan then 
            add 3/4 cup whipping cream and simmer another 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.
        </li>
        <li>Stir a few Tablespoons of the sauce into 1/4 cup of sour cream to temper it 
            so the sour cream doesn't curdle then add it to the pan while stirring constantly.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in 1 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, 
            or season to taste and continue simmering until sauce is creamy. 
            Add beef with any accumulated juices back to the pan and bring just to a simmer or until beef is heated through.
        </li>
    </ol>
