        My father taught me this one. It's American, I think? <a href="https://www.food.com/recipe/cheesy-scrambled-eggs-44656">Original post</a>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-6 Egg (depending on your preference)</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>1 T Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the cheese into tiny squares.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and mash them up with a fork.</li>
        <li>(Be sure to wash the fork to prevent raw egg poisoning.) 
            Put the butter on a pan on a stove-top set on high.
        </li>
        <li>Let it melt and move it around until it covers the entire pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the cheese and the eggs into the pan, and using a fork or something else, 
            spread the eggs around, never letting them stay in one space too long.
        </li>
        <li>Take the eggs out when you desire according to whether you like them hard or soft.</li>
        <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
